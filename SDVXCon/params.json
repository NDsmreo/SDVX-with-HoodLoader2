  "body": "#Sound Voltex Controller Script for Arduino Uno\r\n\r\nThis is for building your own physical controller for the game called [K-Shoot Mania](http://kshoot.client.jp) with an Arduino Uno as a USB interface.\r\n\r\nPrevious alternatives are connecting buttons to disassembled [Joystick circuit](http://homingpuyo.blog91.fc2.com/blog-entry-650.html), or using an [Arduino Leonardo](http://sdvxii.pancakeapps.com/LEONARDO). Arduino Uno cannot interface as a keyboard as easily as Leonardo. Only [Leonardo, Micro, and Due](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/MouseKeyboard) can use the built-in keyboard functions.\r\n\r\n##Features\r\n- Not a joystick, but emulates computer keyboard via USB. (HID interface standard) sdksldksldkdlksdlkdlskdlsddsskdkdkkkkklslskdlsdqooooppppoowowowwoqqqqqpqwwwwwqppqpqpqowowoow\r\n- Supports LED response on all 4 BT + 2 FX + START button.\r\n- Supports encoders with 2 signals (quadrature encoded), e.g. Copal RES20D50-201-1\r\n- Change Uno's input pin easily in the code to suit your project.\r\n- Adjust corresponding keys in the code.\r\n- Adjust sensitivity of knobs and buttons in the code.\r\n\r\n##Requires\r\n- A [firmware flash hack](http://mitchtech.net/arduino-usb-hid-keyboard/) that will make your Arduino HID compatible but loses ability to program. (Need to flash the firmware back to reprogram) (Cannot brick your Uno.)\r\n\r\nPlease wait for more information after I tested the code more. But if you want to go ahead here are rough steps :\r\n- Make a controller.\r\n- Look at the code's top part and config things according to your connections to Uno's pin. Please read the comments. (Important)\r\n- Upload the code to your Uno with the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).\r\n- Do the [firmware flash hack](http://mitchtech.net/arduino-usb-hid-keyboard/).\r\n- Reconnect and done!\r\n",
